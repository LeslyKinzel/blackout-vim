# Neovim Config

I use this repository as a way of backing up and syncing my `~/.config/nvim/` directory across multiple systems.

## Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**

    If you're using gcc, you might be missing some header files. Make sure you have [build-essentials](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-on-ubuntu-20-04/) as a lot of Linux distros don't have it pre-installed.
    If you're on Windows & not using WSL for whatever reason, [winlibs](https://www.winlibs.com/#download-release) worked for me.

- **LSP Dependencies**

    LSPs are managed by [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim). Some LSPs need npm, Go, or some other package manager. Check `:MasonLog` for details about each installation.

- [**NerdFonts**](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
    
    Not mandatory, but will give your terminal all the special characters that make Neovim look cool. Mono fonts are best.
